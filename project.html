            <p>The Narendra Modi Stadium is an international cricket stadium located in Ahmedabad,Gujarat, a state in west India. <br> 
                With a total capacity of 132,000,it is the world's largest stadium. The stadium, owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association, <br>
                hosts both domestic and international cricket matches. <br>
                It is recognized as one of the world's premier cricket venues.The stadium has hosted several high-profile matches, <br>
                such as the 2023 One Day International World Cup final.It is named after the 14th Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. <br>
                This stadium replaced the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Ahmedabad which used to host domestic and international cricket <br>
                in the city until its demolition in 2015. Sardar Patel Stadium was one of the most prominent cricket venues, having hosted <br>
                matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World Cups.[20][21][22] In 2014, it was decided that a new stadium should be built <br>
                on the same plot.[23] The new stadium, originally named Motera Stadium, was designed by Australia's design firm Populous and <br>
                built by Larsen and Toubro. It took five years to build, at an estimated cost of â‚¹800 crore (US$96 million). Once completed, <br>
                the new arena replaced the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The stadium has four dressing rooms, <br>
                11 center pitches, and two practice grounds. The practice grounds can additionally serve as venues for domestic matches.</p>

            <p>Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium (abbreviated as the HPCA Stadium) is an international cricket stadium in Dharamshala
                hill station of Himachal Pradesh, India. The stadium is the home ground of Himachal Pradesh cricket team, Himachal Pradesh women's
                cricket team and headquarter of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, the governing body of cricket in Himachal Pradesh state. <br> 
                It hosted 5 matches of 2023 Cricket World Cup, including New Zealand v India.[3] However the stadium was accused of bad outfield and 
                players played with potential risk of being injured. The stadium served as the home ground for the Himachal Pradesh cricket team for Ranji 
                Trophy matches and other domestic matches. The stadium also hosted some IPL matches as a home stadium for Punjab Kings. The picturesque venue
                is unique in India as it is situated at an altitude of 1,457 m above sea level and has snow-capped Himalayan mountains in the background. <br> 
                Getting to Dharamsala from the nearby Kangra Airport, which is about 8 kilometres away through the hilly terrain and the harsh winters,

            <p>The Arun Jaitley Stadium (formally Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium) is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in 1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25 October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
                In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room after Prakash Bhandari.
                On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. The stadium was officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[5] After announcing the name change, DDCA clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground.</p>

                <p>Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium (abbreviated as the HPCA Stadium) is an international cricket stadium in Dharamshala
                    hill station of Himachal Pradesh, India. The stadium is the home ground of Himachal Pradesh cricket team, Himachal Pradesh women's
                    cricket team and headquarter of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, the governing body of cricket in Himachal Pradesh state. <br> 
                    It hosted 5 matches of 2023 Cricket World Cup, including New Zealand v India.[3] However the stadium was accused of bad outfield and 
                    players played with potential risk of being injured. The stadium served as the home ground for the Himachal Pradesh cricket team for Ranji 
                    Trophy matches and other domestic matches. The stadium also hosted some IPL matches as a home stadium for Punjab Kings. The picturesque venue
                    is unique in India as it is situated at an altitude of 1,457 m above sea level and has snow-capped Himalayan mountains in the background. <br>

                    <p>The Arun Jaitley Stadium (formally Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium) is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in 1883 as the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest functional international cricket stadium in India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25 October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
                        In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman Lamba and the away dressing room after Prakash Bhandari.
                        On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. The stadium was officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the stadium was named after former Indian captain Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[5] After announcing the name change, DDCA clarified that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground.</p>

        matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World Cups.[20][21][22] In 2014, it was decided that a new stadium should be built <br>
        on the same plot.[23] The new stadium, originally named Motera Stadium, was designed by Australia's design firm Populous and <br>
        built by Larsen and Toubro. It took five years to build, at an estimated cost of â‚¹800 crore (US$96 million). Once completed, <br>
        the new arena replaced the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The stadium has four dressing rooms, <br>
        11 center pitches, and two practice grounds. The practice grounds can additionally serve as venues for domestic matches.</p>

        <img src="./Arun_Jaitley_Stadium_during_World_Cup_2023.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p>The Arun Jaitley Stadium (formally Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium) is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District <br> 
            Cricket Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in 1883 as the Feroz <br> 
            Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest functional international cricket stadium in <br> 
            India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25 October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
            In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former <br> 
            India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman <br> 
            Lamba and the away dressing room after Prakash Bhandari.
            On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. <br> 
            The stadium was officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the stadium was named after former Indian captain <br> 
            Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[5] After announcing the name change, DDCA clarified <br> 
            that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground.</p>

        <p>Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium (abbreviated as the HPCA Stadium) is an international cricket stadium in Dharamshala
            hill station of Himachal Pradesh, India. The stadium is the home ground of Himachal Pradesh cricket team, Himachal Pradesh women's
            cricket team and headquarter of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, the governing body of cricket in Himachal Pradesh state. <br> 
            It hosted 5 matches of 2023 Cricket World Cup, including New Zealand v India.[3] However the stadium was accused of bad outfield and 
            players played with potential risk of being injured. The stadium served as the home ground for the Himachal Pradesh cricket team for Ranji 
            Trophy matches and other domestic matches. The stadium also hosted some IPL matches as a home stadium for Punjab Kings. The picturesque venue
            is unique in India as it is situated at an altitude of 1,457 m above sea level and has snow-capped Himalayan mountains in the background. <br> 
            Getting to Dharamsala from the nearby Kangra Airport, which is about 8 kilometres away through the hilly terrain and the harsh winters,

    <p>M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, commonly known as the Chepauk Stadium, is a cricket stadium in Chepauk, Chennai. <br> 
        It is named after former BCCI president M. A. Chidambaram, and is operated by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association. <br> 
        It was established in 1916 and is the second oldest international cricket stadium in the country that is still in use after the Eden Gardens. <br>
       It hosts matches of the Indian cricket team and the Indian women's cricket team apart from matches during major international cricketing events. <br> 
       It serves as the home ground of the Tamil Nadu cricket team and Tamil Nadu women's cricket team for domestic matches. <br> 
       The Indian Premier League (IPL) team Chennai Super Kings plays its home matches at the stadium and the venue hosted the finals of the IPL in 2011, 2012, and 2024. <br> 
       It is also used as a venue for the Tamil Nadu Premier League. Chepauk hosted its first cricket test match in February 1934 during England's tour of India. <br> 
       It subsequently hosted the first match of the inaugural Ranji Trophy in November of the same year. The India cricket team recorded its first test victory in 1952 against England at the venue. <br>

                            <p>Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium (abbreviated as the HPCA Stadium) is an international cricket stadium in Dharamshala
                                hill station of Himachal Pradesh, India. The stadium is the home ground of Himachal Pradesh cricket team, Himachal Pradesh women's
                                cricket team and headquarter of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, the governing body of cricket in Himachal Pradesh state. <br> 
                                It hosted 5 matches of 2023 Cricket World Cup, including New Zealand v India.[3] However the stadium was accused of bad outfield and 
                                players played with potential risk of being injured. The stadium served as the home ground for the Himachal Pradesh cricket team for Ranji 
                                Trophy matches and other domestic matches. The stadium also hosted some IPL matches as a home stadium for Punjab Kings. The picturesque venue
                                is unique in India as it is situated at an altitude of 1,457 m above sea level and has snow-capped Himalayan mountains in the background. <br> 
                                Getting to Dharamsala from the nearby Kangra Airport, which is about 8 kilometres away through the hilly terrain and the harsh winters,

        <img src="./Arun_Jaitley_Stadium_during_World_Cup_2023.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p>The Arun Jaitley Stadium (formally Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium) is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District <br> 
            Cricket Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in 1883 as the Feroz <br> 
            Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest functional international cricket stadium in <br> 
            India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25 October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
            In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former <br> 
            India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman <br> 
            Lamba and the away dressing room after Prakash Bhandari.
            On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. <br> 
            The stadium was officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the stadium was named after former Indian captain <br> 
            Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[5] After announcing the name change, DDCA clarified <br> 
            that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground.</p>

        <p>Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium (abbreviated as the HPCA Stadium) is an international cricket stadium in Dharamshala
            hill station of Himachal Pradesh, India. The stadium is the home ground of Himachal Pradesh cricket team, Himachal Pradesh women's
            cricket team and headquarter of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, the governing body of cricket in Himachal Pradesh state. <br> 
            It hosted 5 matches of 2023 Cricket World Cup, including New Zealand v India.[3] However the stadium was accused of bad outfield and 
            players played with potential risk of being injured. The stadium served as the home ground for the Himachal Pradesh cricket team for Ranji 
            Trophy matches and other domestic matches. The stadium also hosted some IPL matches as a home stadium for Punjab Kings. The picturesque venue
            is unique in India as it is situated at an altitude of 1,457 m above sea level and has snow-capped Himalayan mountains in the background. <br> 
            Getting to Dharamsala from the nearby Kangra Airport, which is about 8 kilometres away through the hilly terrain and the harsh winters</p>

    <p>The Narendra Modi Stadium is an international cricket stadium located in Ahmedabad,Gujarat, a state in west India. <br> 
        With a total capacity of 132,000,it is the world's largest stadium. The stadium, owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association, <br>
        hosts both domestic and international cricket matches. <br>
        It is recognized as one of the world's premier cricket venues.The stadium has hosted several high-profile matches, <br>
        such as the 2023 One Day International World Cup final.It is named after the 14th Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. <br>
        This stadium replaced the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Ahmedabad which used to host domestic and international cricket <br>
        in the city until its demolition in 2015. Sardar Patel Stadium was one of the most prominent cricket venues, having hosted <br>
        matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World Cups.[20][21][22] In 2014, it was decided that a new stadium should be built <br>
        on the same plot.[23] The new stadium, originally named Motera Stadium, was designed by Australia's design firm Populous and <br>
        built by Larsen and Toubro. It took five years to build, at an estimated cost of â‚¹800 crore (US$96 million). Once completed, <br>
        the new arena replaced the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The stadium has four dressing rooms, <br>
        11 center pitches, and two practice grounds. The practice grounds can additionally serve as venues for domestic matches.</p>

        <img src="./Arun_Jaitley_Stadium_during_World_Cup_2023.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p>The Arun Jaitley Stadium (formally Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium) is a cricket stadium owned and operated by the Delhi & District <br> 
            Cricket Association (DDCA) and located on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi.[2][3] It was established in 1883 as the Feroz <br> 
            Shah Kotla Stadium, and named after the nearby Kotla fort. It is the second oldest functional international cricket stadium in <br> 
            India, after the Eden Gardens of Kolkata. As of 25 October 2019, it has hosted 36 Tests, 29 ODIs and 6 T20I.
            In a 2017 felicitation ceremony, the DDCA named four stands of the stadium after former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, former <br> 
            India all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath, former India and Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir. The home team's dressing room was named after Raman <br> 
            Lamba and the away dressing room after Prakash Bhandari.
            On 12 September 2019, the stadium was renamed in memory of former DDCA President and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, after his death on 24 August 2019. <br> 
            The stadium was officially renamed at a function that took place on 12 September 2019. One of the stands of the stadium was named after former Indian captain <br> 
            Virat Kohli on the same date. The name change has been criticised by former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi.[5] After announcing the name change, DDCA clarified <br> 
            that only the stadium had been renamed and that the ground would be still called the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground.</p>

    <p>The Narendra Modi Stadium is an international cricket stadium located in Ahmedabad,Gujarat, a state in west India. <br> 
        With a total capacity of 132,000,it is the world's largest stadium. The stadium, owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association, <br>
        hosts both domestic and international cricket matches. <br>
        It is recognized as one of the world's premier cricket venues.The stadium has hosted several high-profile matches, <br>
        such as the 2023 One Day International World Cup final.It is named after the 14th Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. <br>
        This stadium replaced the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Ahmedabad which used to host domestic and international cricket <br>
        in the city until its demolition in 2015. Sardar Patel Stadium was one of the most prominent cricket venues, having hosted <br>
        matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World Cups.[20][21][22] In 2014, it was decided that a new stadium should be built <br>
        on the same plot.[23] The new stadium, originally named Motera Stadium, was designed by Australia's design firm Populous and <br>
        built by Larsen and Toubro. It took five years to build, at an estimated cost of â‚¹800 crore (US$96 million). Once completed, <br>
        the new arena replaced the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The stadium has four dressing rooms, <br>
        11 center pitches, and two practice grounds. The practice grounds can additionally serve as venues for domestic matches.</p>

    <p>The Narendra Modi Stadium is an international cricket stadium located in Ahmedabad,Gujarat, a state in west India. <br> 
        With a total capacity of 132,000,it is the world's largest stadium. The stadium, owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association, <br>
        hosts both domestic and international cricket matches. <br>
        It is recognized as one of the world's premier cricket venues.The stadium has hosted several high-profile matches, <br>
        such as the 2023 One Day International World Cup final.It is named after the 14th Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. <br>
        This stadium replaced the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Ahmedabad which used to host domestic and international cricket <br>
        in the city until its demolition in 2015. Sardar Patel Stadium was one of the most prominent cricket venues, having hosted <br>
        matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 ICC World Cups.[20][21][22] In 2014, it was decided that a new stadium should be built <br>
        on the same plot.[23] The new stadium, originally named Motera Stadium, was designed by Australia's design firm Populous and <br>
        built by Larsen and Toubro. It took five years to build, at an estimated cost of â‚¹800 crore (US$96 million). Once completed, <br>
        the new arena replaced the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium. The stadium has four dressing rooms, <br>
        11 center pitches, and two practice grounds. The practice grounds can additionally serve as venues for domestic matches.</p>
